									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Ola76/DatawranglingSQL">Data wrangling in<br />
									SQL</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, we undertook extensive data wrangling to analyze the gender distribution of employees in the company on a yearly basis, commencing from 1990. Our focus was on providing a detailed breakdown of the male and female workforce within the organization over time. Through meticulous data cleaning and manipulation, we aimed to generate comprehensive insights into the gender composition and any notable shifts or trends that occurred throughout the years. By delving into this analysis, we sought to gain a deeper understanding of the gender dynamics within the company and potentially uncover valuable insights regarding workforce diversity and inclusivity.</p>
